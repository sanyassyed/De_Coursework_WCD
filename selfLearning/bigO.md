# WHAT IS THE BIG O NOTATION?
* [Source](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/big-o-cheat-sheet-time-complexity-chart/)
* Big O defines the runtime required to execute an algorithm by identifying how the performance of your algorithm will change as the input size grows. But it does not tell you how fast your algorithm's runtime is.
* Big O notation measures the efficiency and performance of your algorithm using `time` and `space` complexity.
