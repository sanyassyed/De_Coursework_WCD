## Linux Symbols & Their Usage:
1. Dollar Sign $
    - Variable Expansion: Expands the value of a variable.
    ```bash

        name="Sam"
        echo $name  # Output: Sam
    ```
    - Command Substitution: Captures the output of a command.

    ```bash

        date_today=$(date)
        echo $date_today  # Output: (current date)
    ```
    - Special Variables:

        * $0: Script name.
        * $1, $2, etc.: Arguments passed to the script.
        * $?: Last command's exit status.
        * $$: Process ID of the current shell.

2. Double Quotes "
    - Preserve Spaces and Special Characters: Allows variable expansion while preserving spaces and special characters.
    ```bash

        greeting="Hello, world"
        echo "$greeting"  # Output: Hello, world
    ```

3. Parentheses ()
    - Subshell: Runs commands in a separate subshell.

    ```bash
    (cd /tmp && ls)  # Changes directory in subshell, doesn't affect the main shell.
    ```
    - Arrays: Used to define arrays.

    ```bash
    fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
    echo "${fruits[1]}"  # Output: banana
    ```
4. Curly Braces {}
    Curly braces are highly versatile in Linux, serving multiple purposes.

    - Variable Expansion with Curly Braces (${})
    Basic Usage: Used to expand variables with clarity or when adjacent to other text.
    ```bash
    var="name"
    echo "Hello ${var}man!"  # Output: Hello nameman!
    ```

    - Length of a String:
    ``` bash
    var="hello"
    echo ${#var}  # Output: 5
    ```

    - Substring Extraction:
    ```bash
    var="hello"
    echo ${var:1:3}  # Output: ell
    ```

    - Default Value if Empty:
    ```bash
    echo ${name:-"Guest"}  # Output: Guest (if $name is empty or not set)
    ```

    - Remove Prefix/Suffix:

        - Remove Prefix:
        ```bash
        path="/home/user/file.txt"
        echo ${path#*/}  # Output: home/user/file.txt
        ```

        - Remove Suffix:
        ```bash
        echo ${path%.txt}  # Output: /home/user/file
        Brace Expansion ({})
        ```

    - Create Numeric Ranges:
    ```bash
    echo {1..5}  # Output: 1 2 3 4 5
    ```

    - Create Alphabetical Ranges:
    ```bash
    echo {a..e}  # Output: a b c d e
    ```

    - Create Lists:
    ```bash
    echo {apple,banana,orange}  # Output: apple banana orange
    ```

    - Batch File Commands:
    ```bash
    touch file{1..3}.txt  # Creates file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt
    rm file{1..3}.txt     # Deletes file1.txt, file2.txt, file3.txt
    ```

    - Nested Brace Expansion:
    ```bash
    echo {A,B}{1,2}  # Output: A1 A2 B1 B2
    ```

    - Grouping Commands with {}: Execute Multiple Commands in the Same Shell:
    ```bash
    { echo "Hello"; echo "World"; }  # Output: Hello (newline) World
    ```
    Spacing: Make sure there is space after the opening { and before the closing }. 
    
    - Arrays and Curly Braces: Access Specific Array Elements:

    ```bash
    fruits=("apple" "banana" "cherry")
    echo "${fruits[1]}"  # Output: banana
    ```

    - Access All Elements:
    ```bash
    echo "${fruits[@]}"  # Output: apple banana cherry
    ```

    - Summary:
        * $: Variable or command expansion.
        * ": Preserve spaces, but allow variable expansion.
        * (): Run in subshell or define arrays.
        * {}:
            - ${}: Variable manipulation (substring, length, etc.).
            - {}: Brace expansion for sequences, lists, and batch operations.
            - {} (for commands): Group commands to execute them sequentially in the same shell.
            - Arrays: Access and manipulate array elements.

## Linux command line perform calculations
- echo $((4+5)) : to add numbers
- var=$((4+5)) : to assign a calculated value to a variable

## `$()` vs `$(())`

- Use `$()` for command substitution (when you want the output of a command).
    
    Example: current_dir=$(pwd)
    
    Use case: Capturing the output of commands, passing results between commands.
    ```bash
    dirname "$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE:-$0}")"
    ```
    You are capturing the output of the dirname command, so you should use `$(...)`, not `$((...))`, because you're working with command output, not arithmetic operations.

- Use `$(( ))` for arithmetic operations (when you need to perform math).
    
    Example: sum=$((3 + 5))
    
    Use case: Basic arithmetic, evaluating expressions.
