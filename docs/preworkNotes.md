## Guideline and basics

### Data Engineering [Source](https://s3.amazonaws.com/weclouddata/data/data/data%20engineering%20concepts.pdf)
* Data
    * Structured - data with rows and cols that can fit in a table
    * Semi-Structured - data that required flattening to fit into a source system. This data does not fit neatly into a table Eg: Json, YML,
    * Unstructured - text, images, sounds, videos etc
* Data Operations:
    * **Data Integration** - Data Integration involves establishing links between operational and analytical services and data sources to enable secure, reliable access to data across multiple systems.
    * **Data Transformation** - Operational data usually needs to be transformed into suitable structure and format for analysis
    * **Data Consolidation** - Data consolidation is the process of combining data that has been extracted from multiple data sources into a consistent structure
* Common Languages:
    * SQL
    * Python
    * R
    * Java
    * Scala
* DE Concepts:
    * Operational Data 
        * Consists of transanctional Data 
        * Generated by apps etc
        * Stored in relational or non-relational DB
    * Analytical Data
        * Data that has been optimized for analysis and reporting
        * Often stored in a Data Warehouse
    * Streaming Data
        * Streaming data refers to perpetual sources of data that generate data values in real-time, often relating to specific events
        * Sources like IOT, social media feed are examples of streaming data source
    * Core Responsibilities of a DE ***(DIM or ETL)***
        1. Design, Implement, and Manage solutions that integrate operational and analytical data sources or
        1. Extract operational data from multiple systems, Transform it into appropriate structures for analytics, and Load it into an analytical data store (usually referred to as ETL solutions).
        1. Implement solutions that 
            1. Capture real-time stream of data
            2. ingest them into analytical data systems, often combining the real-time data with other application data that is processed in batches.
